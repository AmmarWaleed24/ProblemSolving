#ProblemDescription: 
Task
You're given a string of decimal digits s and an integer p. Return an array where the value at index i corresponds to the number of contiguous substrings of s starting at index i which are divisible by 2^p in its number form.
Example
Input: "1048", 3

Expected Output: [2,2,1,1]

Substrings that are divisible by 2^3 = 8
At index 0 (2 substrings) : 104, 1048
At index 1 (2 substrings) : 0, 048
At index 2 (1 substring)  : 48
At index 3 (1 substring)  : 8
